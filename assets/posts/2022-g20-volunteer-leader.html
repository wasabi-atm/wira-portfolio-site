<p>The <b>2022 G20 Bali Summit</b>, held on November 15–16, 2022, in Nusa Dua, Bali, marked Indonesia’s inaugural hosting of the G20. Under the theme <i>“Recover Together, Recover Stronger”</i>, the summit emphasized global collaboration for post-pandemic recovery, focusing on three main pillars:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Global Health Architecture</b>: Enhancing international cooperation to improve global health standards and resilience against future pandemics.</li>
    <li><b>Digital Transformation</b>: Leveraging digitalization to foster inclusive economic growth and bridge the digital divide.</li>
    <li><b>Sustainable Energy Transitions</b>: Accelerating the shift towards cleaner energy sources to ensure a sustainable future.</li>
</ul>

<p>The summit convened leaders from G20 member countries, invited states, and international organizations. Key discussions addressed pressing global issues, including the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and geopolitical tensions, notably the conflict in Ukraine. Despite differing viewpoints, the summit concluded with a joint declaration emphasizing the importance of multilateral cooperation, sustainable development, and collective action to address global challenges.</p>

<h2>What is R20?</h2>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/gbfjTSTN/image.png" alt="R20 Logo">
<p>The <b>R20 (Religion of Twenty)</b> initiative was introduced in 2022 as a forum for religious leaders to contribute to global discussions, particularly within the context of the G20. The R20 aims to promote interfaith dialogue, ethical values, and spiritual perspectives in addressing global issues. While not an official G20 engagement group, the R20 complements the G20’s objectives by integrating moral and cultural dimensions into policy discussions.</p>

<h2>My Role in G20</h2>
<p>Serving as a <b>Volunteer Leader</b> during the 2022 G20’s Religion of Twenty (R20) sub-event was a pivotal moment in my leadership journey. The role went far beyond simply overseeing volunteers—it required high-level <b>coordination, strategic planning, and logistical execution</b> across various domains, all under the pressure of a globally significant diplomatic forum.</p>

<p>As the primary coordinator for my team, I was responsible for:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Budget Management</b>: I was entrusted with planning and monitoring the allocation of the event’s operational budget to ensure efficient use of funds without compromising quality or hospitality standards. Also, I somehow need to make our budget very small considering the pockets of college students. So, in this 6 days, 5 nights event I managed to squeeze our budget to just under IDR 1,000,000 or around USD 60 with everything; hotel, meals, transport provided.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><b>Accommodation & Meals</b>: I liaised with local warungs and caterers to secure comfortable and culturally sensitive lodging and meals for a diverse group of volunteers—ensuring smooth communication. As most of the volunteers are Muslims, I ensured all meals were halal-certified to meet the dietary needs of our predominantly Muslim volunteer group.</li>
    <li><b>Activity Rundown</b>: I developed and managed the detailed event rundown, making real-time adjustments based on schedule changes and logistical constraints. This required close attention to detail and rapid decision-making to maintain the flow of the program for the volunteers.</li>
    <li><b>Cross-Functional Coordination</b>: I acted as the communication bridge between various stakeholders—delegates, event organizers, volunteer teams, logistics vendors, and security. This required tact, diplomacy, and the ability to lead a multicultural, multilingual team in a high-pressure environment.</li>
    <li><b>Team Leadership</b>: I guided a group of 30 volunteers, ensuring they were well-briefed, motivated, and able to represent the event’s values with professionalism. My leadership ensured high team morale and effective delegation of tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>This experience not only honed my abilities in <b>operational leadership and intercultural management</b>, but also demonstrated my capacity to <b>navigate complexity, maintain professionalism under pressure, and deliver high-stakes outcomes</b>. Being trusted with these responsibilities at such a prestigious event was a testament to my ability to lead with clarity, adaptability, and empathy.</p>

<h2>Challenge Faced…</h2>
<blockquote>Literally broke my foot on D-Day😂</blockquote>
<p>Our bus was taking us from our University in Jember to Bali at night. The previous night I haven’t slept very well because we need to prepare medical supplies, communicate with the bus drivers, and also with the morning caterer in Tanah Lot.</p>
<p>In the morning, we arrived at Gilimanuk Harbor and as the representative I need to confirm the pax number in the bus with the local police &amp; military officers. I was very sleepy so when I went back to the bus, I missed the foot rest for going inside the bus.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/whCnXySc/IMG-0488.jpg" alt="My bandaged foot"></p>
<p>You can see I need to wrap my foot in fabric so I can at least still walk. But, walking makes my foot feels like I was barefoot walking over sharp rocks.</p>
<p>Anyway, I still managed to join the 4 days event fully and helped as ground control and liaison officer for the delegates. Everything was okay, it’s just this one mistake made my experience not as pleasant as the other volunteers.</p>

<p>Above was a picture I took with Beau, one of the 30 volunteers whose now working in a really cool NGO.</p>

<p>Here’s my face during the last day of the event, still in pain due to my broken foot…</p>
<p>But overall, I was glad that volunteering in this event made me learn a lot about event management, leadership, and communication. I also learnt a lot on how to empathize with volunteers who got sick in the 2nd day, empathize with the managers that teached us how being able to adapt in any situation and condition is the most important part of a project.</p>

<p>***This experience solidified my belief that empathetic leadership, logistical precision, and adaptability are the core of successful event execution.***</p>
