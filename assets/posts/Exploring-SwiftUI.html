<blockquote>“Learning to write programs stretches your mind, and helps you think better, creates a way of thinking about things that I think is helpful in all domains.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>— Bill Gates</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned in my <a href="https://medium.com/@wirawibisana/the-uncomfortable-truth-why-designers-who-ignore-code-will-be-left-behind-after-2025-637d4841836c" target="_blank">previous article</a>, the ability to code for designers are getting more and more necessary. This is because modern product development is increasingly collaborative and fast-paced — designers who can understand and even write basic code bridge the gap between visuals and functionality.</p>
<p>Designers who understands code are not just handing off static mockups but also contributing to interactive prototypes, catching potential issues early, and even influencing how features are built. In a world where design is expected to be both beautiful and functional, knowing how things work under the hood empowers designers to make smarter, more informed decisions.</p>
<p>In short, a designer who understands the principle of programming will be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Collaborate better with developers</strong> — by speaking their language and understanding technical constraints, leading to smoother handoffs and fewer revisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Design with feasibility in mind</strong> — knowing what’s possible (and what’s not) helps in creating realistic, efficient, and scalable designs.</li>
    <li><strong>Prototype smarter</strong> — using coded designs more effectively to bring ideas to life with real interactivity.</li>
    <li><strong>Think in systems</strong> — programming encourages logical, modular thinking, which translates into more consistent and scalable design systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Automate repetitive tasks</strong> — saving time with scripts, batch processes, or generative design techniques.</li>
    <li><strong>Stand out in the industry</strong> — blending creativity with technical know-how makes a designer more versatile, valuable, and future-proof.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, coding knowledge sharpens a designer’s problem-solving skills and unlocks creative potential grounded in real-world execution.</p>

<h3>Exploring Swift, Native iOS Development</h3>

<p>When I decided to dip my toes into coding, I looked for something that felt close to design — visual, intuitive, and not buried in walls of syntax. That’s why I chose to start with SwiftUI.</p>
<p>SwiftUI promised me a more modern, declarative way to build user interfaces — something that made more sense to my designer brain. I wasn’t trying to become a full-time developer, just someone who could bring their ideas to life a little more independently.</p>
<p>And I’ll be honest — jumping into Swift and native iOS development felt intimidating at first. As a designer, I was used to focusing on how things <em>looked</em> and <em>felt</em>, not how they <em>worked</em> behind the scenes.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>Once I actually got started, I realized it wasn’t as scary as I thought. Apple’s official documentation is surprisingly beginner-friendly enough, with clear examples and explanations that feel like they’re written <em>for humans</em>, not robots.</p>

<p>On top of that, the “<a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui" rel="noopener" target="_blank">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>” course helped break things down into small, doable chunks. It felt less like climbing a mountain and more like going on a daily walk — and before I knew it, I was building real interfaces and playing with animations that I used to only mock up in Figma.</p>
<p>I started from the first day learning basic programming fundamentals and I was like a baby learning how to crawl. Prior to learning Swift, I have never touched a single line of a programming language, I only have basic understanding of HTML which is just a markdown language.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely, concepts like using variables, constants, states, etc. gradually became easier for me to understand. I started having more confidence and able to visualize how the design will look like in Swift’s 3D stack based layout.</p>

<h3>Building My First iOS App with SwiftUI</h3>

<p>The first standalone app I try to build was a simple mindfulness app. One that could let users rate their mood, view their emotional trends through graphs, and play calming audio clips — all without getting too deep into complex back-end logic. It felt like the perfect way to learn while building something meaningful.</p>

</figure>
<p>Working on that app taught me more than just code — it taught me how to think like an iOS developer. I started understanding how data flows, how views update, and how even small user interactions require thoughtful structure.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just about writing Swift; it was about connecting design decisions with real functionality. I learned how to bind mood inputs to state variables, trigger sound playback, and even experiment with Swift Charts to visualize emotional patterns.</p>

</figure>
<p>What surprised me most was how much control I had. I wasn’t limited by design tools anymore — I could actually <em>build</em> the interactions I had in mind that can hardly be truly replicated in Figma.</p>
<p>That feeling of seeing your design come to life exactly the way you envisioned was game-changing. And suddenly, coding wasn’t this scary, technical thing — it became another creative tool in my toolbox.</p>

<h3>Why Designers Shouldn’t be Afraid to Start</h3>

<p>If you’re a designer who’s curious but hesitant about learning to code, I totally get it. I was in the same place — worried that it would be too technical, too complicated, or that I’d have to change my identity as a “creative.” But the truth is, coding didn’t take away from my creativity — it expanded it. It gave me more ways to experiment, more freedom to test ideas, and more confidence when collaborating with developers.</p>
<p>One thing I had to constantly remind myself of was <em>not to compare my progress to full-blown developers</em>. It’s easy to feel behind when you see others building complex apps or writing code that looks like a different language entirely (because, well, it is). But I realized — I’m not here to become the next software engineer.</p>
<p>I’m here to understand just enough to bring my ideas to life and work more confidently with developers. That mindset shift made all the difference. Once I stopped putting pressure on myself to “catch up,” I started learning more freely, with less fear and more curiosity.</p>

<h3>What’s Next for Me</h3>

<p>Now that I’ve gotten a taste of building for iOS, I’m excited to keep pushing my boundaries as a designer-who-codes. I’m currently learning web design with real code — starting by moving my personal portfolio out of Notion and rebuilding it from scratch. It’s a whole new world, but one that’s helping me think more responsively and structure my content with purpose.</p>
<p>I also plan to document my journey exploring more of Apple’s native frameworks — things like NFCKit, Core Motion, and AVFoundation. These are powerful technologies that open up possibilities far beyond what you can prototype in Figma. I want to see how far I can stretch my creativity using hardware and features that are unique to Apple’s ecosystem, and share what I learn with other designers who are curious to do the same.</p>
