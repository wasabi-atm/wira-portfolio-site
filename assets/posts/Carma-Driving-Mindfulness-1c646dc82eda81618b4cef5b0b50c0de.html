<p>As mentioned prior, this project is done by myself from:</p>
<ol>
    <li>User Research</li>
    <li>Lo-Fi Prototype</li>
    <li>Hi-Fi Prototype</li>
    <li>Coding in xCode</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="h3">The Key Problem</h3>
<p>It’s quite difficult to determine the most effective way to calm down the user while they’re still supposed to be focused on the road.</p>
<p>There was a few ideas I thought that can solve the problem with their own questions I ask myself:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Guided mindfulness only when vehicle stops.
        <ol type="a">
            <li>What if the traffic was clear?</li>
            <li>What if the traffic jam was so heavy that the mindfulness prompts gets repetitive?</li>
            <li>What if traffic was like a jammed faucet? How is the trigger?</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Breathing exercises for before/after the drive.
        <ol type="a">
            <li>What if user don’t feel like opening the app after the drive?</li>
            <li>What if the user forgot to open the app before the drive?</li>
            <li>What if the breathing exercise be?</li>
            <li>Mindfulness before/after drive might not be useful if user is in a hurry, how should we tackle this?</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Guided mindfulness during the drive (not dividing focus).
        <ol type="a">
            <li>How should the mindfulness be so it’s not distracting during the drive?</li>
            <li>What should be on the screen during driving so it doesn’t distract her?</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3 class="h3">In this case…</h3>
<p>I decided to go with solution 3, guided mindfulness during the drive as this proposal doesn’t have as much issue when tackling with the unpredictability of traffic.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Problem Statement</h3>
<figure class="callout">
    <div></div>
    <div>
        <p>How can we make daily commute less stressful for those who faces difficult traffic? Because mental state after commute will <strong>affect our feeling for the rest of the day.</strong></p>
    </div>
</figure>
<blockquote><em>“Drivers experiencing stress during traffic often find it difficult to stay calm and present without becoming distracted by their phones. They need a hands-free, passive mindfulness solution that helps reduce anxiety and improve focus without interfering with their driving.”</em></blockquote>

</figure>
<p>To better understand how Carma could fit into a commuter’s daily life, I mapped out the user journey of <strong>Persona 1: The Daily Commuter</strong>. This visual outlines the emotional highs and lows across different stages of their drive—from preparing to leave home, to navigating traffic, to arriving at work. It highlights key pain points such as pre-drive anxiety, stress during stop-and-go traffic, and mental clutter before entering the office.</p>

</figure>
<p>By identifying these emotional touchpoints, I was able to design moments where Carma could provide the most value—through calming soundscapes, subtle mindfulness prompts, and passive support that doesn’t require screen interaction. This journey map helped anchor design decisions around real user needs and revealed when and how mindfulness support should be delivered during a typical commute.</p>

<h3 class="h3">User Interview</h3>
<blockquote>A friend that’s always feel stressed during traffic jam resulting in them having a bad mood for the rest of the day</blockquote>
<p>To better understand the emotional and practical challenges of commuting, I conducted a one-on-one in-depth interview with a daily car commuter who regularly experiences traffic in Denpasar. The goal was to uncover how traffic jams impact her mood, routines, and mental well-being—and what opportunities might exist for a mindfulness-based intervention.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/wirawibisana/interview.png" alt="User interview notes">
</figure>
<p><strong>Key Insights:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Routine Stress:</strong> The interviewee finds parts of her morning routine—like opening the gate and dealing with disorganized traffic—mentally taxing before she even starts driving.</li>
    <li><strong>Emotional Exhaustion:</strong> She often feels overwhelmed, mad, or shocked by how other drivers behave. This leads to emotional fatigue that carries into her day.</li>
    <li><strong>Coping Mechanisms:</strong> Her main strategy to release stress is swearing or venting, which she says helps her feel better temporarily.</li>
    <li><strong>Minimal Relief from Techniques:</strong> She has tried breathing exercises, but found they help only slightly.</li>
    <li><strong>Need for Acceptance &amp; Calm:</strong> She acknowledges the need to “let go” and accept what she can’t control in traffic, suggesting openness to mindfulness-based approaches.</li>
    <li><strong>Infrastructure &amp; Environment Matter:</strong> Better infrastructure in Semarang compared to Bali makes her feel more secure, but other drivers’ behavior and hot, unpredictable weather still impact her mood.</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<p><strong>Opportunities Identified:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>A need for emotional regulation tools that feel accessible and effortless during stressful moments.</li>
    <li>An opportunity to shift traffic time into a reflective or calming space—especially if audio-based and hands-free.</li>
    <li>A chance to reduce emotional burnout by offering micro-mindfulness breaks or check-ins before or after driving.</li>
</ul>
<p>This qualitative data helped shape both the app’s <strong>core value proposition</strong> (a calmer commute) and the emphasis on <strong>audio-first, low-interaction design</strong>.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Design Process</h3>
<h4 class="h4">Sketches</h4>

</figure>

<h4 class="h4">#1</h4>
<p>The initial sketch of this app features a simple play button for starting the mindfulness session. An idea that sticks with me until the end, because after this you will notice that features such as breathing exercise select, the accelerometer function, and the beloved cat mascot will be gone at the end. 😭</p>

<h4 class="h4">#2</h4>
<p>On the second sketch iteration of the app, I focus on the little tings such as navigation of each page. Revamping the rating system to be more intuitive with a slider/selector and the history of mindfulness. You can also see that I’m struggling to choose what navigation system I should use. (Floating button or toolbar)</p>

<h4 class="h4">#3</h4>
<p>On the third and final sketch before I create a paper lo-fi to test with some users, I focus on how to present the breathing exercise with and interesting visual. There’s an idea to use a customizable number system that will signify the ‘seconds’ for each breathing processes (inhale, exhale, and hold)</p>

<hr>

<h4 class="h4">Hi-Fi Prototype</h4>
<p>After validating key ideas through sketches and early lo-fi wireframes, I designed the high-fidelity prototype in <strong>Figma</strong> to closely simulate the final user experience. My main priority was to ensure that the UI would support mindfulness during driving without causing distractions or requiring screen interaction.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/wirawibisana/image%201.png?updatedAt=1751001899833" alt="Hi-Fi Prototype Screenshot">
</figure>
<p><strong>Design Priorities:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Minimalist Visuals:</strong> The interface features large touch targets and high-contrast elements with design hierarchy in mind.</li>
    <li><strong>Single-Tap Interactions:</strong> Users can start or stop a mindfulness session with a single, prominent button—ideal for quick, safe actions while stationary.</li>
    <li><strong>Audio-First Experience:</strong> The prototype emphasized sound as the primary medium—using subtle dark gradients so it doesn’t demand attention while being used while driving.</li>
    <li><strong>No Navigation Overload:</strong> I intentionally removed unnecessary menus or deep navigation layers to avoid complex interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What’s Included in the Hi-Fi Prototype:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>A calming <strong>home screen</strong> with a central play button and gentle visual feedback of button being pressed down &amp; breathing animated opacity.</li>
    <li>An <strong>onboarding flow</strong> that briefly introduces the app’s goals and permissions (e.g., motion access).</li>
    <li>A <strong>mood check-in screen</strong> shown optionally after a session ends, letting users reflect briefly before moving on.</li>
    <li>A <strong>minimal settings screen</strong> to control audio preferences and toggle optional features like breathing reminders.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
<p>The hi-fi prototype helped me gather meaningful feedback in user testing and served as a clear visual reference when building the actual iOS version in Xcode.</p>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
<p>I developed a functional iOS prototype using Xcode and Swift. This allowed me to test the app’s real-world behavior, especially around passive audio playback and minimal screen interaction.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features Implemented:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Background Audio Playback</strong>: Used AVAudioPlayer to play calming soundscapes even when the app is in the background or the screen is off.</li>
    <li><strong>Minimal UI for Safety</strong>: Built a distraction-free interface using SwiftUI, showing only essential controls like a large Play/Pause button.</li>
    <li><strong>Hands-Free Interaction</strong>: Implemented voice-over support and minimized touch interactions to align with driving safety guidelines.</li>
    <li><strong>State Management</strong>: Used @State and ObservableObject in SwiftUI to manage mindfulness session states and audio control.</li>
    <li><strong>Onboarding System</strong>: Used @AppStorage with hasSeenOnboarding status for basic logic of app.</li>
    <li><strong>Trigger System (Planned)</strong>: Began experimentation with CoreMotion to eventually allow mindfulness prompts to adjust based on traffic speed patterns (e.g., stop-and-go detection).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Development Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Handling background audio without draining battery or interfering with other audio sources (like car radios or calls).</li>
    <li>Balancing UX simplicity with necessary control—too few options vs. too many.</li>
</ul>
